# LW_F0_Infinite_density
This is the code for 'Infinite density and relaxation for LÂ´evy walks in an external potential: Hermite polynomial approach' 

'levy_walk_HP.m' and 'levy_walk_F0.m' are the codes to simulate trajectories of L\'evy walk (LW) particle under Harmonic potential and constant external force field, respectively. 

'infinite_distribution.m' is the code to calculate the infinite density for LW under constant force field.

'MSD_qth_mmt.m' is the code to calculate the mean squared displacement and the q-th moment.
